**MY NOTES:**

1. **Fisher's Equation of exchange: MV = PT => P = MV/T**
        - M is the quantity or Money supply
        - V is the velocity(Circulation per year)
        - P is price level i.e price per unit
        - T is the total goods and services transacted or in circulation

    - According to the method, the cryptocurrency price depends on its velocity, the rate at which the currency is used to buy/sell something

    - The higher is velocity, the lower is the price

2. **Metcalfe’s Law**
    - regulates the value of communication networks
    - According to Metcalfe’s law, the value of the network is proportional to the number of users squared
    - this law works pretty similarly by evaluating crypto price by the number of zero balance addresses squared

3. **Price Regression Models**
    - The particular prediction method I used

4. **Cost of Production Models**
    - Evaluates the costs of mining to quantify the price of crypto assets.
    - Can be used to detect crypto bubbles as well

**Crypto Bubbles:**
Most of those models used to detect crypto bubbles work on the generalization of *Metcalfe’s law*, using deviations from it to detect the existence of crypto bubbles
